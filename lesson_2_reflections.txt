What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You intall .git and other directories on it, also it files them in order to make git function properly.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Repo: holds the versions do the documents for comparing.
Working Direc: place to acumulate the code and work on it.
Staging: place to organize the files before commiting, and then making possible an logical order on the commits.
